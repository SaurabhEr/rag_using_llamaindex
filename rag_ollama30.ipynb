      "First, looking at the context table. There's a row labeled 93 with \"Executive-IT\" as the position. The Qualification column says BCA/MCA or equivalent, which makes sense since IT professionals often have computer-related degrees. \n",
      "\n",

So, while PGPX is mentioned in some other positions like AVPs, for this Executive-IT role, it doesn't specify whether PGPX affects the criteria.

      "- Category “C” covers Pay Levels 2 to 4 with 1,40,000/-.\n",
      "- Category “D” is for Pay Level 1 with 70,000/-.\n",

      "Now, the question is about a staff member in Pay Level 3. From the table, Pay Level 3 falls under Category “C”. Therefore, the Sum Assured should be 1,40,000/- based on category C's details provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to make sure I'm not missing any additional information that might affect this calculation. The context mentions various conditions and payment methods but doesn't change the sum assured based on pay level beyond categorization. So, it seems straightforward: Pay Level 3 = Category C = 1,40,000/-.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should double-check to ensure I didn't misread any parts of the context. The relevant section is clearly under the \"AMENDMENT OR DISCONTINUANCE OF SCHEME\" part and the DEPOSIT-LINKED INSURANCE SCHEME section where the categories are defined based on pay levels.
